                            <p>Staring out the window of my middle school science classroom, it seemed like 
                                Hell itself had arrived on the outskirts of Boulder, Colorado. The smoke practically 
                                covered the sun, and the lesson plan was disrupted by the sounds of helicopters 
                                and low-flying planes buzzing back and forth to deliver water and flame retardant to 
                                the Fourmile Canyon fire. That fire would go on to burn 6,181 acres, destroy 168 homes, 
                                and cost an estimated $217 million in property damages.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, that fire is far from an anomaly these days. In 2020, the wildfires in the 
                                western United States cost up to $13 billion in property damages, not to mention the lives 
                                lost and the heartache of countless families forced to rebuild.</p>
                            <p>Wildfires arenâ€™t an unstoppable force â€” it was the efforts of humanity that were able to put 
                                a stop to the Fourmile Canyon fire, and to many other fires that have threatened our communities. 
                                One of the most important tools for fighting fires is understanding where the most high-risk 
                                areas are, so that we can pre-deploy firefighting resources to arrive as soon as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>I was inspired to create a classification tool that could help humanity better stage firefighting 
                                resources after my time in the Data Science bootcamp offered by Metis. I wanted to apply my skills 
                                to this problem that had been a part of my life for years.</p>
                            <div class="sub-section-title">
                                <h3 class="target" id="scientific-background">Scientific background<hr></h3>
                                <p>In order to understand the problem, we have to turn to the field of pyro-geography, the study 
                                    of the geographic distribution of wildfire. When I went to college to get my degree in 
                                    Environmental Science, I learned the basics of this field, and that there are three main 
                                    considerations when it comes to understanding fire risk: fuel, climate, and terrain.</p>
                                <p>Fuel is a pretty obvious one. In areas where thereâ€™s a lot of dead wood to burn, fires will 
                                    be more likely to start, and may grow more quickly than in other areas.</p>
                                <p>Climate is also clear. In areas that have lower than usual humidity, or higher than usual 
                                    temperatures, fires would be more likely and more intense.</p>
                                <p>Terrain is a more interesting variable. Fires tend to spread more quickly when traveling 
                                    uphill, and fires are also more difficult to put out in hilly areas, meaning that fires 
                                    here qualify as higher risk than in flat, more easily accessible areas.</p>
                                <p>I wanted to establish proxies for all of these features so that I could take them into account 
                                    when estimating fire risk.</p>
